# Title

Open Science Tools - authoring and publishing workflows for collaborative scientific writing

# Catalogue Data

## Abstract

Expectations on researchers are increasing. Proposals require data management plans, journals expect data underlying publications to be shared, and there is pressure to make research results reproducible.

It can be overwhelming to identify the tools that are suitable to satisfy these expectations. This course introduces a workflow using Git version control, GitHub, and Quarto scientific and technical publishing system for collaborative scientific writing.

Participants will learn how to use the Quarto file format to prepare a range of scholarly documents, such as: slides, scientific articles, books, websites, and more. We will further use GitHub as a project management tool and demonstrate how it can be used as a publishing platform using GitHub Pages.

## Objective

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- use the Quarto file format and the RStudio IDE visual editing mode for scholarly writing, including the use of citations, footnotes, cross-references, and adding figures and tables
- paraphrase how a file written in a markup language like markdown (.md) differs from a file written in a proprietary file format like .docx
- import references to a Zotero group library
- use an exported library from Zotero in Better BibTex Format to generate an automated reference list in a scientific document
- interact with Git version control and GitHub using the RStudio IDE
- collaborate using the GitHub issue tracker and project management board to organise tasks and reduce email load
- publish a public website using GitHub Pages

## Content

This course provides a hands-on opportunity to learn a set of open source tools and  platforms that are accessible to researchers beyond their employment at any institution. The teaching technique in this course is participatory live coding, as part of which an instructor writes and narrates code out loud as they teach, and invites learners to join them by writing and executing the same code. 

Topics covered are:

- Scientific Communication 
- Reproducible Research (Open Research, Version Control, Licensing)
- Collaboration (Git, GitHub)

This course will introduce tools commonly used in software development. None of these tools will be explained in great detail. The goal is to expose learners to these tools rather than develop a complete understand of the underlying concepts. The course therefore requires an openness to foreign concepts.

## Lecture notes

A public website is in preparation.

## Prerequisites / Notice

While this course does not require experience in any programming language, learners that have previously been exposed to data science tools (R, RStudio IDE, Jupyter Notebooks, Python, VS Code) would be at an advantage and benefit most from this course.

Prior to the course, learners are expected to have:

-   a laptop with internet connection and one of Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (just not the Internet Explorer)
-   a registered account on GitHub (https://github.com/)
-   a registered ORCID iD (https://orcid.org/)
-   read the following paper: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510

The course instructor will contact the registered participants two weeks prior to the course to send a reminder about these prerequisites.

# Performance Assessment

Participants receive 0.5 ECTS for successful participation. This is the equivalent of 15 working hours. The course will be delivered in two modules, each worth 4 hours. The remaining 7 hours will be used for participant preparation prior to the first module and between the first and second module.
