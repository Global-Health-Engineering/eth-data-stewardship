ETH4D Skills Course - Pre-Assessment Questionnaire

# Questionnaire

In the fall semester of 2023, we would like to offer an ETH4D skills course on Open Science (2 half days). Please indicate which statement applies to you. (multiple choice)

- I’m interested in learning about research data management and how to publish data and code openly to make it easily reusable and citable for others (toolset: GitHub, RStudio IDE, Quarto, Zenodo).
- I'm intested in learning how to use reproducible documents to communicate my research in a range of different formats (reports, websites, slides, books) and publish it as (free) websites (toolset: GitHub, R, RStudio IDE, Quarto).
- I’m not interested in any of these topics. 

Which of these best describes your experience with programming in general?

- I have none.
- I have written a few lines now and again.
- I have written programs for my own use that are a couple of pages long.
- I have written and maintained larger pieces of software.

Which of these best describes your experience with programming in R?

- I have none.
- I have written a few lines now and again.
- I have written programs for my own use that are a couple of pages long.
- I have written and maintained larger pieces of software.

Which of these best describes how easily you could write a program in any language to find the largest number in a list?

- I wouldn’t know where to start.
- I could struggle through by trial and error with a lot of web searches.
- I could do it quickly with little or no use of external help.

What best describes how you store the majority (> 90%) of your research data?

- I use a proprietary file format (e.g XLS, XLSX, Google Sheets)
- I use a machine readable file format (e.g. CSV, JSON, XML)
- I use a software system for processing and managing data, including features to extend or update, transform and query the data (e.g MySQL, PostgresSQL)
- none of the above

What best describes how you currently document your research (projects)?

- I use a formatted text software system (MS Word / Google Docs / LibreOffice Writer / Apple Pages) and separate software to perform data analysis.
- I use a plain text software system with markup tagging conventions (LaTeX, Markdown) and separate software to perform data analysis.
- I use a notebook in which I can combine my written narrative and code for analysis (i.e. literate programming), such as Jupyter Notebook, R Markdown
