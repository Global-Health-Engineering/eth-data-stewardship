- # ETH4D skills course
    - The following two proposals were prepared for consideration in a [ETH4D skills course](https://eth4d.ethz.ch/Learning/courses-and-programmes/eth4d-skills-courses.html) in Summer 2023
- # Proposal 1
    - Title 
        - Publish your data openly and get credit for it
    - Goal
        - The goal of this workshop is to teach students how they can benefit from applying FAIR data principles to a data set that originates from their research
    - Learner Profile
        - This workshop is for you, if:
            - you care about data and code being easily resuable
            - you know how to use (or are willing to learn) common data science tools (Git, GitHub, R, RStudio IDE, Quarto)
            - you question existing processes and want to change how academia values scientific contributions
    - Learning Objectives
        - By the end of this course, students will be able to:
            - write metadata using a literate programming tool (Quarto publishing systems)
            - paraphrase how a file written in a markup language like markdown (.md) differs from a file written in a proprietary file format like .docx
            - interact with git version control and GitHub using the RStudio IDE
            - apply standards for writing a codebook to a tabular data set
            - publish data openly using GitHub and Zenodo integration to receive a DOI
            - add a data publication record to a created ORCiD profile
            - understand how FAIR data principles apply to published data sets
- # Proposal 2
    - Title
        - Share your research with the world - Is there something you can't do with Quarto? 
    - Goal
        - The goal of this workshop is to teach students how the use of modern authoring tools can lead to increased efficiency and reach. 
    - Learner Profile
        - This workshop is for you, if:
            - you care about data and code being easily resuable
            - you have can find your way around any common data science tool (R, RStudio IDE, Jupyter Notebooks, Python, VS Code)
            - you question existing processes and want to change how academia values scientific contributions
    - Learning Objectives
        - By the end of this course, students will be able to:
            - publish a website using GitHub Pages
            - prepare scientific reports, slides, personal websites and books using the Quarto publishing system
            - paraphrase how a file written in a markup language like markdown (.md) differs from a file written in a proprietary file format like .docx
