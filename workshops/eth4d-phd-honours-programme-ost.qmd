# Background

This workshop was designed for an Honours Programme in Sustainable
Transitions, offered by five European universities ([IDEA
League](https://idealeague.org/)), [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science
and Technology in Ghana](https://www.knust.edu.gh/about), [Strathmore
University in Kenya](https://strathmore.edu/), and the NGO [Green Growth
Africa](https://thegreengrowth.org/about-us/).

The title of the programme is: AMBITION - Ambassadors for sustainable
transition

# Title

Open Science Tools - authoring and publishing workflows for
collaborative scientific writing

# Responsible Partner

ETH Zurich

# Overview

As the expectations of researchers increase, publishing reproducible
scientific articles becomes essential. However, choosing tools for these
tasks can be difficult. This course aims to guide researchers through
these challenges by introducing a workflow that utilizes Git, GitHub,
and the Quarto scientific and technical publishing system for
collaborative scientific writing.

# Learning objectives

1.  Learn to use the Quarto file format and the RStudio IDE visual
    editing mode to produce scholarly documents with citations,
    footnotes, cross-references, figures, and tables.

2.  Interact with Git version control and GitHub through the RStudio
    IDE.

3.  Collaborate with other researchers using the GitHub issue tracker
    and project management board to organize tasks and streamline
    communication.

4.  Publish a public website using GitHub Pages to share research with a
    broader audience.
